          Vectors Part 1<br>
          What are vectors
        </section>
        <section>
          A vector is a list (or array) of numbers.
        </section>
        <section>
          Dimension of a vector is how many numbers it contains.<br>
          We mostly care about 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors.
        </section>
        <section>
          Notation<br>
          Horizontal (row vector): $[0,1,2]$<br>
          Vertical (column vector): $\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{smallmatrix} \right]$
        </section>
        <section>
          2d: $x, y$<br>
          3d: $x, y, z$<br>
          4d: $x, y, z, w$<br>
        </section>
        <section>
          Examples<br>
          2d: $x, y$<br>
          $a = \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right]$<br>
          $a_1 = a_x = 0$<br>
          $a_2 = a_y = 1$<br>
        </section>
        <section>
          Examples<br>
          3d: $x, y, z$<br>
          $a = \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{smallmatrix} \right]$<br>
          $a_1 = a_x = 0$<br>
          $a_2 = a_y = 1$<br>
          $a_3 = a_z = 2$<br>
        </section>
        <section>
          Examples<br>
          4d: $x, y, z, w$<br>
          $a = \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{smallmatrix} \right]$<br>
          $a_1 = a_x = 0$<br>
          $a_2 = a_y = 1$<br>
          $a_3 = a_z = 2$<br>
          $a_4 = a_w = 3$<br>
        </section>
        <section>
          A vector is just a directed line segment with magnitude and direction
        </section>
        <section>
          Magnitude is the length of the vector
        </section>
        <section>
          Direction is the way the vector is pointing in space
        </section>
        <section>
          Illustration<br>

        </section>
        <section>
          Displacement: "walk backwards two steps"
        </section>
        <section>
          Velocity: "the train is going South at 20MPH"
        </section>
        <section>
          Displacement and velocity are different than distance and speed.
          The former two are vector quantities and have a direction.
          The latter two are scalar quantities and do not have a direction.
        </section>
        <section>
          Vectors are numbered with a signed displacement.<br>
          In 2D: $[1,2]$ means to $x$ is forward $1$ and $y$ is up $2$
        </section>
        <section>
          Vectors can be represented by a sequence of displacements.<br>
          In the previous 2D example: the sequence $[1,0]$, $[0,2]$ would result in the same $[1,2]$
        </section>
        <section>
          A vector is different than a point. A point specifies location, whereas
          a vector specifies magnitude and direction.
        </section>
        <section>
          The point $(2,1)$ can be reached given the vector $[2,1]$, relative
          to the origin of the coordinate system.
