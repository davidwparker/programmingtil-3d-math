          Euler Angles<br>
          Orientation / Angular Displacement
        </section>
        <section>
          "Oiler" Angles<br>
          Define an angular displacement as a sequence of three rotations about three
          mutually perpendicular axes.<br>
          What axes? What order?<br>
          Normally use the cardinal axes and the "heading-pitch-bank" convention.
        </section>
        <section>
          Heading-pitch-bank<br>
          Orientation is defined by a heading angle, a pitch angle, and a bank angle.<br>
          Recall we're using the left-hand system: +x is right, +y is up, +z is forward.<br>
          Heading is first and rotates about the y-axis<br>
          Pitch is second and rotates about the (object space) x-axis<br>
          Bank is last and rotates about the (object space) z-axis
        </section>
        <section>
          Order is heading, pitch, then bank- when rotating object from inertial
          space into object space.<br>
          If rotating from object space into inertial space, then it is the opposite:<br>
          bank, pitch, then heading.<br>
          Similar to "roll-pitch-yaw" where bank is synonymous with roll, and
          yaw is pseudo-synonymous with heading, and in the reverse order.

          Conventions<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any three mutually perpendicular axes can define an orientation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any three axes can be used as the axes of rotation- they don't have to be
              cardinal axes.
            </li>
            <li>
              It isn't necessary to define left or right-hand rules for which direction
              is positive for each rotation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rotations can be in a different order, and order does matter. Heading-pitch-bank
              is just the most common and normally most useful.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Advantages of Euler Angles<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Easy for humans: The numbers used are angles, which is how we think
              about orientation. When orientations need to be displayed, then
              the only real choice is euler angles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smallest memory: 1/3 the size of matrices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any set of three numbers is valid: there may be incorrect numbers
              but any three numbers will always be valid.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Disadvantages of Euler Angles: Aliasing<br>
          The representation for a given orientation is not unique: for any given
          orientation, there are many Euler angle triplets that can describe that
          orientation. An example would be adding $360^{\circ}$ to
          one angle. Also each angle isn't independent of the others: pitching
          down $135^{\circ}$ is equal to heading $180^{\circ}$ pitching down $45^{\circ}$,
          and banking $180^{\circ}$. To solve this issue, we normally restrict range of
          angles (heading/bank to $\pm180^{\circ}$, pitch to $\pm90^{\circ}$)
        </section>
        <section>
          Disadvantages of Euler Angles: Gimbal Lock<br>
          Famous aliasing problem- if we pitch angle of $\pm90^{\circ}$ then we can
          only rotate about the vertical axis. The first and third rotations are
          then rotating about the same axis.<br>
          To fix this issue, all rotations about the vertical axis are assigned to
          heading in the Gimbal lock scenario (bank is then zero).

          Disadvantages of Matrix Form: Interpolation<br>
          Interpolating between two angles is difficult.<br>
          Naive solution (non-canonical Euler angles):<br>
          $\Delta\theta = \theta_1 - \theta_0$<br>
          $\theta_t = \theta_0 + t\Delta\theta$<br>
          The issue with this is that if orientation A is $720^{\circ}$, and orientation
          B is only $25^{\circ}$, we'll spin around the axis in the wrong direction
          multiple times before getting to the correct orientation.
        </section>
        <section>
          Disadvantages of Matrix Form: Interpolation<br>
          Canonic Euler Angles:<br>
          Orientation A = $-160^{\circ}$<br>
          Orientation B = $160^{\circ}$<br>
          Only $40^{\circ}$ apart, but goes the wrong way around to get to it.<br>
          Solution: wrap them<br>
          $wrap(x) = x - 360^{\circ} \left\lfloor{(x + 180^{\circ})/360^{\circ}}\right\rfloor$<br>
          $\Delta\theta = wrap(\theta_1 - \theta_0)$<br>
          $\theta_t = \theta_0 + t\Delta\theta$
