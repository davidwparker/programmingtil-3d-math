          Matrix Orientation <br>
          and Angular Displacement
        </section>
        <section>
          Orientation is given by a rotation from a known reference orientation
          (identity or home orientation).<br>
          This rotation amount is called angular displacement.
        </section>
        <section>
          Orientation will be used in for parent/child relationships<br>
          Angular displacement will be used for source/destination relationships<br>
          The distinction between the two is similar as the distinction between
          points and vectors, mathematically equivalent but not identical conceptually.

          Advantages of Matrix Form<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rotation of vectors is immediately available: use a matrix to
              rotate between object and inertial space.
            </li>
            <li>
              Format used by graphics APIs: you can do other forms internally
              but must convert into matrices at some point.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          Advantages of Matrix Form<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Concatenation of multiple angular displacements: if we know
              orientation of obj A to obj B and obj B to obj C, then we know
              obj A to obj C.
            </li>
            <li>
              Matrix inversion: easy to compute the opposite angular displacement.
              Due to rotation matrix being orthogonal, trivial to compute transposing the matrix.

          Disadvantages of Matrix Form<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Matrices take more memory: nine numbers needed instead of only three.
              If we have an animation with 10 parts, at 15 Hz, that's 150 orientations/second.
              With 32-bit floating point numbers: $15*9*32/8 = 5400$ bytes/frame.
              Euler Angles would only be 1800 bytes.
            </li>

          Disadvantages of Matrix Form<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Difficult for humans: too many #s, all between -1 and 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Matrices can be malformed: six degrees of redundancy (nine numbers
              when only three are needed).
            </li>
          </ul>

          Disadvantages of Matrix Form<br>
          How can we end up with a bad matrix?<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Suppose we have a matrix that contains a scale, skew, or reflection.
              There is no definition of an orientation of an object affected by these.
              Any non-orthogonal matrix is not a well-defined rotation matrix.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may get bad data from an external source (modeling software, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Floating-point round off errors. This is known as matrix creep.
            </li>
          </ul>
